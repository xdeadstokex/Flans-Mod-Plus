Special note for guns - all animation variables that you can change in the gun's model file can be changed from here as well. Simply:
`animVARIABLENAME` in this style `variableVariableNameA` for variableNameA. anim always lower case, first letters of any other word upper case. For vector3fs, 
`animSomeVariable 0 -4 4`
for animation types:
`animAnimationType BOTTOM_CLIP`

This will override the value set in the gun's model!
